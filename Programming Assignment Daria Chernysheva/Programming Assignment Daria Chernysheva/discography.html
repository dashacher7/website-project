      <h3>$outh $ide $uicide (2015)</h3>
      <p>
        A good starting point that shows their darker sound and emotional lyrics.
        <p>$outh $ide $uicide or $$$ is the eighteenth album by underground rap sensation, $uicideboy$ featuring Floridian rapper Pouya.</p>
      <p></p>The most popular song on this album is “$outh $ide $uicide” and "
Runnin’ Thru the 7th with My Woadies"

      <h3>Eternal Grey (2016)</h3>
      <p>
        This album mixes aggressive tracks with more atmospheric production.<p>
      </p>
      <p>The legendary Eternal Grey marks the $uicideboy$‘ 7th full-length mixtape. Their reappearance includes the two exploring their avid drug use, overshadowing their competition, and showing off their newly found success after their surge in popularity following their previous Dark Side of the Clouds mixtape.<p>

      </p>

      <h3>My Liver Will Handle What My Heart Can't (2015)</h3>
      <p>
        Recommended for listeners who want a deeper look into their styles <p>
        The title is another way of saying “I will drink my problems away.” 
        When people go through hard times (like those mentioned on the album), a lot of people will resort to alcohol to cope with the pain that their heart “can’t handle.”
      </p>The most popular song on this album is “Kill Yourself (Part III)”

  <h2>THY KINGDOM COME (2025)</h2>
  <p class="album-note">Good next step after the playlist, easier on the ears, more calmer than before, not the latest album since they released the second part of this album "Thy Will Be Done" in December 2025</p>
