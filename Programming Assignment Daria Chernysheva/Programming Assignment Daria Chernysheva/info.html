      <h1>About $uicideboy$</h1>

      <p>
Suicideboys (stylized as $uicideboy$) is an American hip-hop duo from New Orleans, Louisiana. Suicideboys were founded in 2013 by cousins Scott "Scrim" Arceneaux Jr. and Aristos "Ruby da Cherry" Petrou. The duo initially rose to popularity on SoundCloud for their abrasive, self-produced beats and harsh lyrical content, as well as their music videos and themes prominently featuring substance abuse and suicidal ideation. They own and operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is distributed by The Orchard.

      <p>
        Their music blends elements of underground hip-hop, trap, punk, and horrorcore,
        often exploring darker themes such as mental health struggles, addiction,
        depression, and existential pain. These topics are presented honestly and without
        filtering, resonating with a global audience.
      </p>

      <p>
The duo is considered one of the most popular acts in the underground rap scene. After several years of solely releasing EPs and mixtapes, Suicideboys' debut studio album I Want to Die in New Orleans was released on September 7, 2018. It fared well commercially, becoming their first top-ten album on the US Billboard 200. In May 2019, they released their collaborative six-track EP with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker entitled Live Fast, Die Whenever, which also featured Korn guitarist James Shaffer.

<h2>How I discovered them</h2>
  <p>
    I discovered $uicideboy$ completely randomly around four years ago. I was watching
    a live stream and the streamer played a song in the background. I went through
    the chat to find the name, and it turned out to be <em>“Kill Yourself (Part III)”</em>.
    I liked it instantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    What hooked me wasn’t that I personally related to every topic in the lyrics,
    but the overall style: the way they rap, the way the beats hit, and the unique
    atmosphere in their songs. It introduced me to a new kind of genre that I ended
    up loving. After that first discovery, it took me a while to dive deeper, and
    even now I feel like I still have more to explore in their music.
  </p>

  <h2>Seeing them live</h2>
  <p>
    I finally saw them live when I travelled to Florida in July/August. It wasn’t
    planned at first because we were supposed to leave earlier, but we managed to
    stay longer—and I got to accomplish a dream of mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    The concert was amazing. The whole arena was singing along, the music was
    blasting, and the pyrotechnics made everything feel even more intense. It’s
    definitely a night I’ll remember forever.
